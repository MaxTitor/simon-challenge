# Simon-Challenge

My solution to the Simon game challenge from Angela Yu's webdev bootcamp.
Yeah the code is a bit messy, but that's because I'm still learning to be a programmer, I did not use any of the hints, and I did a personal challenge to myself to finish this in only a day!
All in all, I'm very happy with how it turned out.
I also took the liberty of adding a few things.
The color buttons are disabled before the game starts, and get disabled in the game over screen.
I also added a dialog to the announcer that tells you when you've passed a level.
